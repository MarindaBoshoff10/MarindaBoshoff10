- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marinda Boshoff (@MarindaBoshoff10)
- ðŸ‘€ I am a software engineering student with a background in computer science. I am currently enrolled at Fontys University of 
 Applied Science as a semester 6 student looking for a graduation project. I was previously enrolled at the Techinal University of 
 Eindhoven where I completed half of a bachelor in Computer Science before switching to Fontys. 
 I have been working part time as a software developing intern for the last 3 years, so I have plenty of experience in a working environment.
- ðŸŒ± I was born and raised in South Africa so I speak Afrikaans and English. After
finishing high school I came to the Netherlands to study and have been enjoying my time
here every since!
